    description: "A set of Bluray covers created for the Netflix series Black Mirror. The covers have episode specific visual elements to differentiate while still being a cohesive collection. The colours are based on each episode colour palette and the general tone the episode has. For example, Nosedive has an obvious pastel colour palette and the tone of the episode is a lot more lighthearted than most episodes, while Metalhead is monochrome and is an episode that explores a dystopian, dark future. Different coloured papers were used for printing and a transparent sheet was attached to the top to produce the layered effect which reflects the layers of the stories in the series."

  description: "A typographic language for the Cannes Film Festival was created and translated into the context of a large scale poster and a smaller scale publication. Through extensive research about the festival and its history, conceptual elements were imbued into the formal visual typographic elements. The repetition reflects the aspects of the festival's glamour (flashing cameras, the famous red carpet steps, the theatre seating) and film production (film frames, editing). The larger 3D type, moving into and occupying the space of the page, reflects the historical context and the exclusive aspect: a festival created during political conflicts of the World Wars and invasions in France; and a festival in which only the film industry is invited and the general public peers in.
